# PING-PONG
This is my version of the iconic Ping-Pong game. I have created this game using UNITY GAME-ENGINE and C# scripting.
- I have used some predefined classes and functions in unity by referring to the unity documentation. You can check that out [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingSection.html)
- I have created my own script to make the ball bounce.

This was my first project and this game turned out to be great with no or minimal errors.
